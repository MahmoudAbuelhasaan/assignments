In Python, when multiple inheritance is used and two parent classes have the same method name, 
the method of the first parent class in the inheritance list (left-most) will be called.
 This is known as the "Method Resolution Order" (MRO) in Python.


In Python, when a child class inherits from multiple parent classes that have constructors (i.e., __init__ methods),
 only the constructor of the first parent class in the inheritance list will be executed automatically.

The reason for this is that Python uses duck typing and it's dynamic nature,
 which means that the type of an object is determined by its behavior,
 not by its class definition. This approach emphasizes readability and ease of use over strict typing,
 which is why method overloading is not needed.

Moreover, method overloading can lead to code that is harder to understand and maintain,
as well as code that is harder to debug. In Python, the use of default arguments, variable-length arguments,
and method overloading through different names can help make the code more readable, maintainable, and understandable.
